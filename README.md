# The PCR Test Challenge - Mapping COVID Hotspots in the US

## Project Introduction
The PCR Test Challenge aims to map COVID hotspots in the US based on text results provided by PCR tests. In this research project, we leverage additional features from the dataset to predict and identify areas with a higher risk of COVID transmission. By analyzing the data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to gain insights into the patterns and factors contributing to the spread of the virus.

## Dataset Overview
The PCR Test Challenge dataset is available on the project website under the name `virus_data.csv`. This dataset contains a variety of features that are relevant to our prediction tasks. Along with the text results provided by PCR tests, the dataset includes additional features that can provide valuable information for mapping COVID hotspots in the US.

## Learning Process and Performance Evaluation
During the learning process, we measure the performance of our models using two disjoint sets: training and test. The training set is used to train the machine learning algorithms, enabling them to learn the relationships between features and target variables. The test set provides a final estimate of the model's performance after training. It is important to note that test sets should not be used to make decisions about algorithm selection, improvement, or tuning.

Later in the course, we will introduce another data subset called the validation set. The full dataset will be split into a training set, containing 80% of the data selected randomly, and a test set, containing the remaining 20%. We will explore the significance of this data partitioning as we progress through the course when evaluating models. For now, remember that only the training set should be used for making decisions about the data.

## Data Exploration and Feature Transformation
To begin, load the PCR Test Challenge dataset using the pandas library and explore its contents. It is important to consider the target variables and their relevance to our prediction tasks during the data preparation process. Additionally, non-numeric features will need to be transformed into meaningful numeric representations as many learning algorithms accept only numeric inputs.

## Note
This project is part of an ongoing research initiative. Please ensure that any use or analysis of the dataset adheres to the project's guidelines and ethical considerations.
